== Description ==

BP Group Control is a set of tools that gives group admins the ability to create new members for their groups, add existing users to their groups, directly delete members, and assign their members an identifying tag ( the group name ) that shows up next to their display name on their profile and directories. These features are supported by a rich options page that allows site admins to tweak the permission settings for these abilities.

Be careful with this plugin! Make sure you trust your group admins with the power you grant them.

You can choose to have different parts of this plugin active for public vs private groups as well.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `bp-group-control` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress MUST ACTIVATE AS SITEWIDE
3. If you mess up and activate it not sitewide, you'll get a white screen until you delete the BP Group Control directory and start again. Don't freak out though, your site will be fine once you do this. (Once I officially host this on wordpress.org I will have found a way to avoid this.)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the options page? =

Settings -> BP Group Control

= What does "make identifying" mean on those buttons everywhere? =

It means it will make the current group the identifying group for either yourself (if it is on a group homepage or your "my groups" list) or another user (if it is on another user's "my groups" list).
